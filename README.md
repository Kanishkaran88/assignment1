    System.out.print("Enter your age: "); //get input from user
    int age = input.nextInt();

    // Check 
    if (age >= 18) { 
        System.out.println("You are old enough to vote in a national election.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("You are not old enough to vote in a national election.");
